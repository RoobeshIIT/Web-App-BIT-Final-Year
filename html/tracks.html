    <h1>MUSIC VINYL</h1>
    <p>
        Listening to music has become an integral part of our lives.
        We listen to the music during a commute, daily runs, when we’re trying to relax, or when we just want to keep up
        with our idols’ latest tunes.
        These days we have a multitude of ways to listen to music online, and if you’re looking for something good to
        listen to your to one of your favorite trending tunes, this is the post you should be reading.
    </p>
    <p>
        An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or
        another medium such as digital distribution.
        Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a
        bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP)
        records played at 33+1⁄3 rpm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the
        field, or a mix of places.
        The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years.
        This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or
        "mixed" together.
        Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed "live", even when done in a studio.
        Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other
        locations, such as concert venues and some "live rooms", have reverberation, which creates a "live" sound.
        Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc.
        With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening
        to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track.
    </p>
    <p>
        Album covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the
        recording, and lyrics or librettos.
        Historically, the term "album" was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format.
        In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth
        century.
        Later, collections of related 78-rpm records were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78-rpm record could
        hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound).
        When LP records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an "album"; the
        word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, Compact audio cassette, 8-track tape
        and digital albums as they were introduced.

    <h2>Selena Gomez Forbes </h2>
    <img src="../img/selena_gomez.jpg" class="img_e" alt="Selena Gomez">
    <p>
        Selena Marie Gomez who was born on the July 22 1992, is an American singer, actress, and producer.
        She has been regarded as a "triple threat".
        Born and raised in Texas, Gomez began her acting career on the children's television series Barney & Friends (2002–2004).
        In her teenage years, she rose to prominence for her lead role as Alex Russo in the Disney Channel television series Wizards of Waverly Place (2007–2012).
    </p>
    <p>
        Selena first gained an interest in pursuing a career in entertainment watching her mother prepare for stage productions.
        She began auditioning for various roles and met Demi Lovato during an audition for Barney & Friends.
        Both Gomez and Lovato were later selected to appear on the series in 2002,with Gomez portraying the character Gianna.
        The show was her first acting gig.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gomez is described as a pop artist with a mezzo-soprano vocal range. 
        Her work is primarily characterised as dance-pop and EDM; however, she has experimented with different music genres. 
        Her debut album with the Scene was influenced by electronic rock and pop rock, while her subsequent records with the band opted for a dance-pop sound. 
        A Year Without Rain noted synth-pop characteristics, and When the Sun Goes Down featured a more electropop and electro-disco musical direction.
        Her debut solo album Stars Dance was rooted in the EDM-pop genre—Gomez herself described it as "baby dubstep"—drawing elements from electronic, disco, techno, and dancehall.
        Her songs "The Heart Wants What It Wants" and "Good for You" have been described as "minimalistic" and "grown-up", introducing a more adult pop sound into her repertoire.
    </p>
    <p>
        In October 2008, Gomez participated in St. Jude's Children's Hospital's "Runway For Life" benefit.
        That same month, Gomez was named UNICEF's spokesperson for the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign, which encouraged children to raise money on Halloween to help children around the world.
        In August 2009, Gomez, then 17 years old, became the youngest UNICEF ambassador (Millie Bobby Brown later surpassed this record).
        Gomez was named spokesperson for UNICEF's 2009 Trick-or-Treat campaign for the second year in a row.
        She raised over $700,000 for the charity in 2008 and stated that she hopes to be able to raise US$1 million in 2009.
        Gomez participated in a celebrity auction and hosted a live web cast series on Facebook in support of the Trick-or-Treat campaign.

        Derulo was born in Miramar, Florida, the son of Haitian parents.
        He started singing at a young age. 
        He attended performing arts schools in Florida and made some early attempts at music composition, writing his first song at the age of eight.
        His writing skills began attracting attention when he was a teenager.
        He also wrote "Bossy" for Birdman, a New Orleans-based rapper, and made a guest appearance on the song, highlighting his ability as a vocalist.
